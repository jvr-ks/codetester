# Codetester ![Icon](https://github.com/jvr-ks/codetester/blob/main/codetester.ico?raw=true)  
 
#### Description  
**Codetester is UNDER CONSTRUCTION!**  
  
Simple App (Windows &gt; 10, 64 bit only) to quickly test an Autohotkey script (called "CUT" = "Code under test").  
I use it to quickly tryout code or parts of code.  
  
Needs an installed [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/) version 1+ and/or version 2+!  
  
Writes the code to the temporary file "_tmp.ahk" and executes it via Autohotkey.  
The code is saved as "_codetester.txt" and restored on restart.  
  
Special features of **Codetester** are:  
* Can observe variable content via the "showvar()" function \*1),  
* Automatically switches to AHK2 if "#Requires AutoHotkey v2" is found,  
* Copy code to the clipboard (from a webpage etc.) and press \[F7]-Key or (\[F8]-Key to run it as an AHK1- or AHK2-Script,  
* CUT is interruptible by pressing the \[Escape]-key,  
* Store the code to one of three files (1, 2, 3).  
* Quick exchange the code with one of three (a, b, c) "shadowareas"
  
If you need a good editor to be used with autohotkey-scripts, 
give [SciTE4AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/scite4ahk) a try!  
   
Uses the [Scintilla](https://www.scintilla.org/) Textcontrol (Scintilla.dll).  
Block move with tab: Indentation is 2 spaces (fixed).  
  
Code based on: [https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/72566-code-tester-test-your-code/](https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/72566-code-tester-test-your-code/frudimentary)  
   
**Codetester uses the clipboard, clipboard-content is not saved!**  

\*1) Codetester does not support breakpoints,  
     use [SciTE4AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/scite4ahk), if breakpoints are required.  
     "showvar()": run Codetester.exe, mark a variable, press \[Ctrl] + \[c] and then the Insert: \[Showvari]-button.   
 
#### Download via Updater (preferred method)  
Portable, run from any directory, but running from a subdirectory of the windows programm-directories   
(C:\Program Files, C:\Program Files (x86) etc.)  
requires admin-rights and is not recommended!  
**Installation-directory (is created by the Updater) must be writable by the app!** 
  
To download **codetester.exe** 64 bit Windows from Github please use:   
  
**[updater.exe 64bit](https://github.com/jvr-ks/codetester/raw/main/updater.exe)**  
  
(Updater viruscheck please look at the [Updater repository](https://github.com/jvr-ks/updater))  
  
* From time to time there are some false positiv virus detections  
[Virusscan](#virusscan) at Virustotal see below.  
  
#### Start:  
* Run "updater.exe", example: "C:\jvrks\codetester\updater.exe" once to download/update Codetester.  
* Then start "codetester.exe", example: "C:\jvrks\codetester\codetester.exe" !  
(Create a dektop-icon or a taskbar entry).  
If your Autohotkey is not installed in the default directories,  
change the entries:  
Configuration-file -&gt; \[setup] -&gt; ahk1exepath="C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\AutoHotkey.exe"  
Configuration-file -&gt; \[setup] -&gt; ahk2exepath="C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\v2\AutoHotkey64.exe"  
accordingly (A restart of Codetester is required).  
  
Example (AHK 1/2):  
````  
; Example AHK1 / 2

#Warn All, Off

a := "test finished"

loop 3 {
  s := A_Index . " hello ðŸ˜ƒ "
  showvari("i",  s ) 
  sleep 1000
}

showvari("A_AhkVersion",  A_AhkVersion ) 

version := A_AhkVersion

toDisplay := a . " ðŸš´"


if (!InStr(version,"1."))
  msgbox toDisplay
else
  ;not valid in AHK 2, so use #Warn All, Off
  msgbox test finished  ðŸš´

exitApp
````  
  
Codetester itself uses "UTF-8-RAW" file encoding.  
**The CUT uses "UTF-8-RAW" as default file encoding also!** (v 0.168+),  
set by Configuration-file -&gt; cutFileEncoding.  
  
#### Codetester Hotkeys  
Are defined in the Configuration-file.  
   
Hotkey | Operation  |  Remarks  
------------ | ------------- | -------------  
\[CTRL] + \[u] | test selected-code-only | Testing selected-code-only      
\[ESC] | stop the script under test | unnecessary if the script under test has an "exitApp"-command.   
\[F7] | run the current content of the clipboard as AHK v1 script  \*1)  
\[F8] | run the current content of the clipboard as AHK v2 script \*1)  
\[F1] | if UnicodeList is active only: show quick-help  
\[F2] | if UnicodeList is active only: show clipboard contents as UTF-8 and copies it to the clipboard  
\[F3] | if UnicodeList is active only: show clipboard contents as URI and copies it to the clipboard  
  
\*1)  
- Codetester must be running,  
- directives are used,  
- no codemodifications are made (Codetester builtin functions are not usable),  
- "#Requires AutoHotkey vX" is prepended.  
- code can be inspected, toggle-button: "Controlarea" -&gt; "Show: _tmp.ahk".  
  
Example show current AHK version (AHK version independant):
````  
DllCall("MessageBox", "Uint", 0, "Str", A_AhkVersion, "Str", "Current used Autohotkey version", "Uint", "0x0000000")
````  
  
#### Build-in functions  
Description | Operation | Usage  
------------ | ------------- | -------------  
showvari("Variable-name", variable) | Displayed in Debug-window | To generate the code mark a variable, then press the button "showvari"  \*2) 
 
\*2)  
If a "showvari" function is used, the codetester-gui stays in front!  
"showvari" logs to the file "debug.log" too.  
You may run the script (AHK 1 or 2) "_tmp.ahk" by doubleclicking on the file.  
If "showvari()" is used, leave the Codetester window open to receive debugging messages!  
  
  
#### Configuration-file   
The Configuration-file ("codetester_&lt;ComputerName&gt;.ini") is generated automatically, if it does not exist already.  
There is a menu-button to edit the Configuration-file.  
Hotkeys can be set to "off" by adding the word "off" to the definition.  
  
[Sourecode at Github](https://github.com/jvr-ks/codetester), "codetester.ahk" an [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com) script.  
  
Put your test-code in the box (via the clipboardor or the \[Get code from Notepad++] button).  
Then click the Button or the hotkey to execute your test-code.  
  
Click on the End-Button or use the hotkey to stop execution of your test-code.  
You can also mark a part of your test-code with the mouse to execute this part only.  
Use the hotkey to start in case of selected test-code.  
   
You can put any function as an ahk-file in the Lib subdirectory,  
(it's the Autohotkey mechanismen for ahk-files with function-names),  
or us the standard #Include mechanism.  

#### Configuration-file backup / autorestore
If the directory "C:\Users\&lt;UserName&gt;\AppData\Roaming\codetester\" is usable,
the app saves a copy of the Configuration-file to this backup-directory.  
If the Configuration-file is missing,  
an attempt is made to restore the file from the backup directory.  
Otherwise a new Configuration-file is created, containing default-values.  
  
#### Configuration-file empty directives-entries  
If a configuration parameter is not contained in the Configuration-file  
or is contained but has a blank value, a default value is used.  
  
To force directives-entries to become empty, use the value "#empty!".
  
#### Directives  
Can be used as usual and/or set in the Configuration-file -&gt; \[directives] -&gt; directive1= ... directive6=  
(6 max.).  
If Authokey 2 is selected (the code contains "#Requires AutoHotkey v2 ..."),  
Configuration-file -&gt; \[directives2] are used.  
Directives defined in the Configuration-file are prepended to directives contained in the code,  
hence those contained in the code take precedence.  
  
Example:  
Configuration-file setting:  
```` 
\[directives1]  
directive1="#SingleInstance Force"
directive2="#Warn, All, MsgBox"  
directive3="#NoEnv"  
...  
directive6=  

\[directives2]
directive21="#SingleInstance Force"
directive22="#Warn"
directive23=""
...  
directive26=""
````  
#### Button "Show: _tmp.ahk" 
Use the button "Show: _tmp.ahk" / "Close: _tmp.ahk"  
to show the content of the file "_tmp.ahk".  
This file is executed, if a run-button is pressed (or F7/F8).    
Changes to the content are not saved, the file is overwritten by any Run-command. 
  
#### Get from NP++ / Copy to NP++  
The "Get from NP++"-button selects \*3) the complete text of the topmost Notepad++ window  
an **overwrites** the Codetester content,  
"Copy to NP++"-button inserts the text from the Codetester window at the current cursor (caret) position,  
or replaces the currently seleted text (uses the clipboard and a "Ctrl + v" command).  
  
\*3)
The selection keeps activated so that the next "Copy to NP++" operation  
is not an insert but an overwrite operation (a desired behavior).   

  
#### Disable code mods  
If checked the following code modifications are disabled during a test run:  
- no additional code to use the "showvari-function" is included,  
- replacing "exitApp" by sendInput,{ESCAPE} is disabled,  
- FileEncoding is not set to "UTF-16" (keeping default fileencoding),  
- Debug Area is not auto-shown if code contains a "showvari-function".  
- Including directives from the Configuration-file is NOT disabled.  
  
#### Reserved names   
The following limitations apply with the code-under-test (CUT):  
  
Name | remarks  
------------ | -------------
_codetester* | some variable-names reserved by Codetester  
**showvari** | reserved by Codetester  
  
#### Msgboxes are automatically moved  
All msgboxes are moved to the top left, to prevent them to be hidden by the Codetester Controlbox!  
Repetive msgboxes are shifted a little bit right-down.  
  
#### EXCH buttons  
By pressing one of the EXCH-buttons, the current content is exchanged with a second content-storage,   
(Using the file "_saved\__codetester_exchNUMBER.ahk.txt", NUMBER = 1,2 or 3),  
independantly from the other Read1...3/Save1...3 buttons.  
(Code text must contain at least one newline character!)  
Only one EXCH can be active at a time.  
On closing the app, the EXCH status is reset.  
  
#### Codetester Controlarea  
Press "Escape" to show the Controlarea (if hidden).  
  
##### AOT button  
If enabled the Codetester Controlarea stays **A**lways **O**n **T**op.  
If the Codetester code-edit-area is hidden, press the ESCAPE key.  

##### ESCAPE key  
Pressing the ESCAPE key  
- stops any running code.  
- reactivates the Codetester code-edit-area.  
  
#### Hotkeys  
[Overview of all default Hotkeys used by my Autohotkey "tools"](https://github.com/jvr-ks/codetester/blob/main/hotkeys.md)  
  
#### Hotkey Converter button  
Simple tool to get the hotkey from pressed keys.  
  
#### UnicodeTable  
A basic UnicodeTable using UTF-16 row and column indexes, but each characters is UTF-8 encoded,  
UTF-8 support must be enabled -&gt; "Enable Unicode UTF-8" below.  
Use \[Alt] + \[Down] or \[Alt] + \[Up] to scroll the pages,  and  
**\[Alt] + \[Enter] to close the table** or the "Controlarea"  buttons.  
  
Hints:  
- Non-Breaking-Space character is displayed as a blank,  
  but is NBSP (UTF-8: 0xC2 0xA0) UTF-16: 0x00A0, i. e. row 0000A0, column 00

#### Enable Unicode UTF-8  
Windows uses Unicode UTF-16 as the default,  
but the Scintilla control uses UTF-8.  
To use the full Unicode characterset, enable UTF-8 support in Windows:  
[Enable Unicode UTF-8 (Windows 10)](https://www.jvr.de/2022/07/30/unicode-in-console-windows-10-en_us/)
  
#### Hints  
Maximum size of code is 60 MB!  
  
#### Fonts  
Default is "Consolas" but I prefer ["Source Code Pro"](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro/releases)  
Configuration-file -&gt; \[config]  
fontSCI="Source Code Pro"  
fontsizeSCI=11  
  
#### Make \*.exe   
A standard Autohotkey (64 bit) installation is required (C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey ...).  
The code is used to create an executable-file named "_codeToExe.exe" (64 bit) or "_codeToExe32.exe" (32 bit).  
- Functions supplied by Codetester are not usable (besides the directives-mechanism),  
  "showvari()" is automatically commented out therefor.  
- "sendInput,{ESCAPE}" is replaced by "exitApp".  
  
The sourcecode can be inspected in the file "_codeToExe.ahk"!  
Feel free to rename the executable-file to any name you want ... :-)  
Hint: use UPX to compress the EXE-file!  
  
#### Using Scintilla  
Codetester Scintilla.dll may be used in CUT with:  
AHK 1 (turn off warnings, i.e. set Config-file -&gt; \[directives1] -&gt; directive2 to "#empty!"):  
#include, codetesterLib\codetesterLib_SCI.ahk  
AHK 2:  
(Download  
* "scintilla.dll",  
* "scintilla.ahk" and  
* "CustomLexer.dll",  
from [AHK v2 Script Converter](https://github.com/mmikeww/AHK-v2-script-converter/archive/master.zip)  
to the "_sci2Lib/..." directory!  
  
Example (AHK 2):  
````
; is supplied by codetester config #SingleInstance Force
; is supplied by codetester config #Warn  
#Requires AutoHotKey v2.0+

#Include _sci2Lib/scintilla.ahk

FileEncoding "UTF-8-RAW"


guiMain := Gui("+Resize")
guiMain.Title := "Test Scintilla AHK V2"
guiMain.MarginX := "0", guiMain.MarginY := "0"

SB := guiMain.Add("StatusBar")
SB.SetParts(300, 300)

edit1 := guiMain.AddScintilla("x10 y10 w800 h600 VtheCode DefaultOpt LightTheme")
edit1.callback := sci_Change
edit1.Doc.ptr := edit1.Doc.Create(500000+100)

edit1.Tab.Use := false
edit1.Tab.Width := 2

guiMain.Show()

return
;-------------------------------- sci_Change --------------------------------
sci_Change(*){
  global guiMain, SB, edit1

  guiCtrlObj := guiMain.FocusedCtrl
  if (IsObject(guiCtrlObj)){
    CurrentCol := EditGetCurrentCol(guiCtrlObj)
    CurrentLine := EditGetCurrentLine(guiCtrlObj)
    oSaved := guiMain.Submit(0)
    currentLineContent := edit1.Text
    tooltip currentLineContent
    SB.SetText("Line: " CurrentLine " Column: " CurrentCol , 2, 1)
  }
}

````
  
#### Menu -&gt; Allfiles -&gt; Update Allfiles  
Generates a single file including all sources found in the "saved" directory by using "allfilesBetter.exe"  
from the github project [AllfilesBetter](https://github.com/jvr-ks/allfilesBetter).  
If Codetester is installed via Updater "allfilesBetter.exe" is already downloaded.  

#### Menu -&gt; Allfiles -&gt; Open Allfiles  
Uses the default editor associated with *.txt-files or  
the app defined in Configuration-file -&gt; \[setup] -&gt; texteditorpath="&lt;path to the editor.exe&gt;"  
to open the file generated by Update Allfiles (= allfilesBetter.exe).  
The benefits are:  
* Easy search of code fragments  
* A kind of "backup"  
  
"allfilesBetter.exe" needs an installed Java (&gt; 8) runtime!  

#### Contextsensitiv Help  
Removed from Codetester, please use the new  
[AutohotkeyHelp2](https://github.com/jvr-ks/simpletools?tab=readme-ov-file#AutohotkeyHelp2)  
which has identical functionality!
